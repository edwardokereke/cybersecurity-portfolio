# Career Simulation 3 – Incident Investigation & Mitigation

## Overview
This simulation focused on identifying security weaknesses, validating access paths, and documenting remediation strategies in a simulated enterprise environment.

## Objectives
- Identify exposed services and insecure configurations
- Validate findings using command-line and network tools
- Assess risk and potential impact
- Propose realistic mitigation strategies

## Tools & Techniques
- Nmap (service and port discovery)
- Linux command-line analysis
- SSH access validation
- Permission and configuration review

## Key Findings
- Misconfigured services exposing unnecessary access
- Weak access controls increasing attack surface
- Insufficient monitoring and logging controls

## Mitigation & Recommendations
- Restrict exposed services to required ports only
- Harden SSH access and authentication methods
- Apply principle of least privilege
- Improve logging and monitoring for detection

## Skills Demonstrated
- Incident analysis under pressure
- Evidence-based documentation
- Security hardening recommendations
- Clear communication for technical and non-technical audiences

⚠️ **Note:** All findings are sanitized. No credentials, flags, or sensitive data are included.
